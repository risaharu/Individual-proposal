    "Proposal #1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Research question \n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a relationship between how often an individual engages socially and their overall life satisfaction score? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variables and justifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent Variable: CONNECTION_social_days_friends_p7d_grouped \n",
    "--> This variable represents the frequency of social engagement with friends over the past week. Higher engagement is expected to correlate with better emotional well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependent variable: WELLNESS_life_satisfaction\n",
    "--> This variable measures overall life satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10, providing a quantitative assessment of an individualâ€™s subjective well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification for Variables:\n",
    "Understanding the impact of social engagement on life satisfaction is crucial, as a lot of studies have suggested that social interactions play a significant role in enhancing well-being. By examining these specific variables, we can gain insights into the extent to which social engagement contributes to an individual's perception of life satisfaction.\n",
    "I will use box plots to visualize the distribution of life satisfaction scores across different levels of social engagement. This approach is appropriate because it allows us to compare the median life satisfaction scores, the interquartile range, and potential outliers across different frequencies of social interaction. Additionally, I will calculate the mean life satisfaction for each group to provide a summary statistic of the relationship that may highlight trends in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analysis Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the relationship between social engagement and life satisfaction, I will perform an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test. This method is suitable for comparing the means of life satisfaction scores across multiple levels of social engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedure:\n",
    "First, I will categorize the CONNECTION_social_days_friends_p7d_grouped variable into distinct groups (e.g., none, some days, most days, every day). Then, I will perform the ANOVA test to determine if there are statistically significant differences in life satisfaction scores among these groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "The assumptions for ANOVA include normality of the distribution of scores within groups and independence of observations. I will assess these assumptions before conducting the analysis to ensure valid results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesize that individuals who engage socially more frequently will report higher life satisfaction scores compared to those who engage less frequently. Specifically, I expect to find that the mean life satisfaction score will significantly differ across the engagement groups, with higher scores corresponding to higher frequencies of social interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: \n",
    "The results of this analysis will provide valuable insights into the impact of social engagement on life satisfaction, helping to address the research question. If a significant positive relationship is found, it could suggest that promoting social interaction may be beneficial for improving overall well-being, thereby informing policies and practices aimed at enhancing community engagement and mental health support."

    "Proposal #2: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Research question \n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a relationship between the number of close friends and self-rated mental health among Canadians?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variables and justifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent variable: CONNECTION_social_num_close_friends_grouped\n",
    "--> This variable categorizes respondents based on the number of close friends they report, such as none, 1-2, 3-4 and 5 or more. I am choosing this variable because social support is often linked to better mental health outcomes, and understanding the number of close friends can shed light on the importance of social connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependent variable: WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health\n",
    "--> This variable represents self-rated mental health scores (poor, fair, good, very good and excellent). It provides a subjective measure of mental health, making it relevant for assessing the impact of social relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use the histogram to show the distribution of respondents by the number of close friends they report. It will illustrate the frequency of different levels of close friendships, providing a clear view of the population's social connections. Also, I might use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the number of close friends and self-rated mental health. It allows for the observation of patterns or trends, helping to identify any correlation between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Analysis plan\n",
    "\n",
    "I will do a correlation Analysis which will quantify the strength and direction of the association between the number of close friends and self-rated mental health scores. Then I will do a linear regression analysis to assess whether the number of close friends significantly predicts self-rated mental health ratings, allowing for an evaluation of the impact of social connections on mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "The relationship between the variables should be reasonably linear for correlation and regression analysis. Observations (respondents) are independent, ensuring that the results are not influenced by overlapping social networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesize that Canadians with a greater number of close friends report better self-rated mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance: If this hypothesis is supported, it could highlight the importance of fostering close friendships in improving mental health. This information would be valuable for mental health awareness campaigns aimed at promoting social connectedness and could guide community programs that encourage building and maintaining social networks for enhanced well-being. \n",

    "1. Reseearch question\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the frequency of meaningful interactions with family affect self-reported life satisfaction among Canadians?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variables and justifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent variable: CONNECTION_meaningful_interactions\n",
    "--> This variable measures the frequency of meaningful interactions with family. It is chosen because the quality and frequency of family interactions are hypothesized to have a significant positive impact on well-being. Meaningful family connections can provide emotional support, enhance feelings of belonging, and contribute to overall happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependent variables:WELLNESS_life_satisfaction\n",
    "--> This variable represents self-reported life satisfaction scores from 1 to 10.  It is essential to explore this variable as it reflects individual perceptions of well-being, which can be influenced by social interactions, including those with family. Analyzing life satisfaction can provide insights into how social relationships affect overall happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use boxplot to compare life satisfaction scores across different levels of meaningful interactions. The boxplot is appropriate as it effectively displays the median, quartiles, and potential outliers, providing a clear view of the distribution of life satisfaction across interaction levels. Then, I might use bar chart to show  the average life satisfaction score for each level of interaction. A bar chart is suitable for illustrating differences in means between groups, making it easy to interpret the overall trends in life satisfaction. Eventually, if the frequency of interactions is measured continuously, a scatterplot can reveal trends between meaningful interactions and life satisfaction. This visualization allows for the examination of the potential linear relationship between the two variables.\n",

    "3. Analysis plan \n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the mean, median, and standard deviation of life satisfaction scores for different levels of meaningful interactions. This will provide an overview of how life satisfaction varies with interaction frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will do t-tets to chekc if there are significant differences in life satisfaction scores across different levels of interaction frequency. This is essential for determining whether the frequency of interactions has a meaningful impact on life satisfaction. Then, if the interaction frequency is continuous, simple linear regression could assess the linear relationship between meaningful interactions and life satisfaction. It is crucial for quantifying the strength and direction of the relationship.\n",

    "Assumptions: \n",
    "Life satisfaction scores are normally distributed within each interaction group, which is important for the validity of statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "I expect to find a positive relationship between meaningful family interactions and life satisfaction. Individuals who engage more frequently in meaningful interactions with family are hypothesized to report higher life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relavence: \n",
    "These results could provide important insights for public health campaigns and social initiatives. If a positive association is found, it can reinforce the importance of maintaining meaningful family connections to promote well-being. The findings could also be used by organizations for awareness campaigns aimed at improving life satisfaction through social connections.\n"
